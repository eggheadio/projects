# Reconstruct an App in TailwindCSS

In [Craft Scalable, Custom-Made Interfaces with Tailwind CSS](https://egghead.io/courses/craft-scalable-custom-made-interfaces-with-tailwind-css-8dfee898), Sam uses the Discord app as a way to teach TailwindCSS to you.

For your project, you are going to do the same with a different website or application.

For instance, take the Reddit home page for example. 

![reddit homepage](https://github.com/eggheadio/egghead-projects/blob/main/reconstruct-an-app-in-tailwind/reddit.png?raw=true)

By recreating this home page you'll implement many common UI components and patterns that production apps employ. There's the nav up top as well as expanding list items on the left hand side column with a feed of posts running down the middle. 

Use the same techniques that you learned from Sam to implement the UI of your choice. 

Other ideas include:

- Slack
- Twitter
- Facebook
- Netflix
